# Fast Fibonacci

This is a simple (yet hopefully) fast implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Python using Jax with matrix exponentiation.

The justification (explanation) and analysis of the method in the notebook [/notebooks/explanation.ipynb](https://github.com/munozariasjm/efficient-fibonacci/blob/master/notebooks/explanation.ipynb)

Also we show how the Jax implementation is faster than alternative implementations in the notebook [/notebooks/efficient_implementation.ipynb](https://github.com/munozariasjm/efficient-fibonacci/blob/master/notebooks/efficient_implementation.ipynb).

Finally the clean implementation is in the file (/src/matrix_exponentiation.py).

## Installation

To run the code you need to install Jax. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install jax[cpu]
```
